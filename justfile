# Full local CI equivalent — run this before pushing.
# The recipe IS the contract: if CI runs a check and this does not, the gate is

# something smaller ONLY where running complete CI locally is impractical.
pre-push: ci

# Runs on every commit, so it must stay FAST — a sub-minute budget. Tests belong
# here when they fit; lint alone when they do not. If fmt-check reformats
# anything it fails the commit: re-stage its changes and commit again.

# Content checks inherited from overcommit when it was removed (2026-09-12):
# MergeConflicts, YamlSyntax, JsonSyntax. RuboCop and the test target were already
# covered by fmt-check/lint/test; HardTabs and TrailingWhitespace were dropped because
# they fight shfmt, .tsv, and generated files.
